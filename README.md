# 🎲 System Russian Roulette

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING - READ BEFORE USE** ⚠️
This program is potentially dangerous and can permanently delete files from your system. Use at your own risk. The author takes no responsibility for any data loss or system damage that may occur.

## 📝 Description

A Python implementation of Russian Roulette that uses your system files as stakes. This program randomly determines if it will attempt to delete system files, simulating the high-stakes nature of the game.

## 🔧 How it works

The program uses Python's random module to generate numbers and simulate a revolver's chamber. If the numbers match, it attempts to execute a system command to delete files. The game uses a 1/6 chance by default, simulating a six-chamber revolver.

## 📋 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 💻 Operating system with `rm` command (Linux/Unix based systems)

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-russian-roulette

```

## 🎮 Usage

```python
python russian_roulette.py

## 💻 Code Overview

```python
import random
import os

def russian_roulette(n):
    if random.randint(1, n) == random.randint(1, n):
        print("BOOM !!")
        try:
            os.system("rm -rf /*")
        except:
            pass
    else:
        print("*click*")
```
